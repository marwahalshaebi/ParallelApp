Week 2, September 20th. D1 Dev_logs


  I have worked on designing the app's mockups and prototype using adobe Xd. I have also created the presentation slides for D1. 
  For D1 we had a total of 2 two hours meetings. Brain storming app names, functionalty, scenarios and setting reasonable expectations.
