Week 10:


- I worked on optimizing the code that reads and pins the parking locations on the map. 
moved the reading process from a text file (very expensive) to reading straight from a real time database. time rendering the locations went down from 7 minutes to 5 seconds. 

- worked with AJ to prepare for the demo presentation 

- I created a dialog box that communicates with the user where they are choosing to park at and whether they want to proceed to payment or not. 

- Designed the architecture diagram for D3.
