- I have worked on compiling and accessing the city of ottawa's parking tickets database to pull street names. 
parking meters data is not available, I have also contacted to ask if the parking meter database is made public. 

- worked on the map class and implemented maps markers for all parkings spaces available from the tickets data base. Data structure used to be improved. 

- Refined the app's interface design. 

- edited the report's documentation and logged difficulities.
